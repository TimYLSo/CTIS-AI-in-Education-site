**How is AI incorporated in assignments**

Whether educators like it or not, students are finding ways to incorporate AI into their school assignments. According to a study from the School of Psychology, Swansea University, United Kingdom out of a sample of 160 students' undergraduate students almost 32% indicted that they would use generative AI tools in their work([Playfoot, David et al., 2024](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190779688&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&sot=b&sdt=b&s=TITLE-ABS-KEY%28ai+assignments%29&sl=29&sessionSearchId=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&relpos=1)). Similar surveys have produced similar results worldwide. a survey done by the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education reveals that 63.6% of survey participants from around the world are likely or very likely to employe the use of generative AI in the future([Yusuf abdullahi et l., 2024](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188508655&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&sot=b&sdt=b&s=TITLE-ABS-KEY%28ai+AND+usage%29&sl=29&sessionSearchId=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&relpos=7)). From these findings it’s very clear that AI is no longer a niche tool. Most students are aware of it in at least some capacity, and many are actively using it in their work.

**How are teachers regulating AI usage**

AI use in assignments and assessments can be difficult to detect and therefore prove challenging to regulate in a classroom context. A randomized controlled experiment _Do teachers spot AI? Evaluating the detectability of AI-generated texts among student essays_

[(Fleckenstein, et al, 2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000109?via%3Dihub). Done with 200 English speaking teachers concluded that teachers cannot differentiate between AI and student work. From this it’s clear that teachers will need to implement more complex approaches to the regulation of AI. ... (Connect to AUT AI Policy/Other Unis)

**How can AI be used as a tool for educators and students**

Since the release of these popular generative AI tools students and teachers have taken to many diverse applications of AI in education. One study by the Journal of computer assisted learning ([Safaa M. Abdelhalim, 2024)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcal.12948) which investigated 27 EFL (English as foreign language) undergraduates found that students use ChatGPT in many ways such as a tool for thought stimulation, A search engine for supplementary information and a tool for guidance. The study concluded that for students to effectively utilize ChatGPT they needed skills such as “prompt formulation, systematic thinking” and “self-regulation”.

**Ethical Issues with AI:**

The swift introduction of Generative AI into education has prompted many institutions to ban its usage while they evaluate the ethics of its systems and impacts on learning in their institutions. These ethical considerations are important as the decisions of these educational institutions with influence society in the long term as students graduate and pass their habits into academia and or the workforce. Two studies from the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education([Abbas, Muhammad, 2024](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s41239-024-00444-7.pdf)) sampled 659 students in total and found that students who frequently used ChatGPT in their work had a lower CGPA (Cumulative Grade Points Average). This correlation calls into question students' reliance on such tools and the quality of understanding they present. From this information it’s clear why many universities have banned its usage as they want to maintain the quality of their students and academia.

Another key issue with Generative AI highlighted in _Investigating the Impact of AI on Ethics and Spirituality (_[_Swati Chakraborty, 2023, c. 2_](https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/book/318133)_)_ is its adaptation of human bias. The data used to train these Generative AI is scraped from the internet in massive quantities which makes it extremely difficult to filter prejudice and misinformation. Quiet often these models pass this bias into their responses in subtle ways. These biases can be passed into academia, the workplace and wider society. Ironically it can also be passed back into the model when work made using AI is published, enforcing its already existing bias. These biases are quite often harmful to society as they can misrepresent underrepresented groups and give false impression of someone's beliefs.
