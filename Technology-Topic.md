Whether educators like it or not, students are finding ways to incorporate AI into their school assignments.
According to a study from the School of Psychology, Swansea University, United Kingdom out of a sample of 160 students' 
undergraduate students almost 32% indicted that they would use generative AI tools in their work
([Playfoot, David et al., 2024](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190779688&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&sot=b&sdt=b&s=TITLE-ABS-KEY%28ai+assignments%29&sl=29&sessionSearchId=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&relpos=1)). 
Similar surveys have produced similar results worldwide. 
a survey done by the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education reveals that 63.6% of
survey participants from around the world are likely or very likely to employe the use of generative AI in the future
([Yusuf abdullahi et l., 2024](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=3-s2.0-85188508655&origin=resultslist&sort=plf-f&src=s&sid=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&sot=b&sdt=b&s=TITLE-ABS-KEY%28ai+AND+usage%29&sl=29&sessionSearchId=059b8e81ec17e6cfa3d9a60635ee2ad0&relpos=7)). From these findings itâ€™s very clear that AI is no longer a niche tool. Most students are aware of it in at least some capacity, and many are actively using it in their work.
