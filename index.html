</ul><p>Whether educators like it or not, students are finding ways to incorporate AI into their school assignments. According to a study from the School of Psychology, Swansea University, United Kingdom out of a sample of 160 students' undergraduate students almost 32% indicted that they would use generative AI tools in their work(Playfoot, David et al., 2024). Similar surveys have produced similar results worldwide. a survey done by the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education reveals that 63.6% of survey participants from around the world are likely or very likely to employe the use of generative AI in the future(Yusuf abdullahi et l., 2024). From these findings itâ€™s very clear that AI is no longer a niche tool. Most students are aware of it in at least some capacity, and many are actively using it in their work.</p>
