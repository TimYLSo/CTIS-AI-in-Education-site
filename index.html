	<h1>CTiS: AI in Education</h1>


	</ul><b>Introduction</b>
	<p class="main-text">
		The twenty first century has brought around many different technological developments globally. As new technologies are introduced itâ€™s important for their impacts on society to be assessed and critically evaluated. This evaluation ensures that the technology and the people behind it function as ethically as possible. When such new technology is not ethically evaluated it can be detrimental to society. One such new technology that has become popularized over the past few years is Generative AI. Companies such as OpenAI have found ways to incorporate their AI model into many aspects of the internet such as search engines and customer support. Weather intentional or not models like ChatGPT have also made their way into education and academia. Almost every student has heard the name ChatGPT, and each have their own thoughts and options on it making it a hot and relevant topic to talk about.
