  <h1>Technology Choices</h1>

  <h4>What choices do Soceity/The individual have when it comes to Generative AI</h4>

  <p class="main-text">
    When it comes to Generative AI in education there are several choices that society, individuals and educational
    institutions can make to adapt to this this new technology





  </p>
  <p class="main-text"> <b>Banning the use of AI </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    This option entails universities outright banning the use of tools like ChatGPT. The breach of which would be
    considered an academic integrity issue. Since both novice and experienced teachers could not
    meaningfully distinguish between text written by students or ChatGPT <a
      href="references.html#reference_3">(Fleckenstein, et al. 2024)</a>, detection would
    most likely rely on digital tools similar to existing tools that exist in higher education to detect
    plagiarism.However, even with current tools available educators are often not able to accurately detect AI generated
    content. <a href="references.html#reference_6">Perkins, et al. (2024)</a> reported that an AI detection tool
    detected
    only 54.5% of the AI generated
    submissions. While it can be argued that detection tools are likely to improve, the consensus is that the
    improvement of generative AI itself is also likely to improve<a href="references.html#reference_7">(Lee, et al. 2024
      )</a>. Sole focus on the improvement of
    these detection tools will likely lead to a cat and mouse game that favours generative AI.

    <br><br>
    Overall, while strict regulation affording the use of generative AI is important, sole reliance on detecting and
    punishing these actions often does not address the root cause of the problem. <a
      href="references.html#reference_1">Playfoot et al.(2024)</a> indicates that
    there is a correlation between degree apathy and likelihood of utilizing generative AI to cheat.This suggests that
    generative AI does not increase the amount of academic dishonesty but simply provides another tool for people who do
    not care about learning to dishonestly obtain their degree.
    <br>
    <br>

    Unfortunately, this response stops students from getting any of the benefits of AI in their learning
    however it ensures that students work is their own and not written by a model. One key problem with this choice is
    that itâ€™s hard to implement as detecting weather work is AI or not is incredibly difficult.

  As a wider society we also have a lot of say on its usage weather we want to adapt it to become a part of all our
  lives or limit its usage to protect us from its ethical issues. These choices must come from governmental or global
  bodies to ensure coordination and ensure that ethical concerns are managed appropriately.
