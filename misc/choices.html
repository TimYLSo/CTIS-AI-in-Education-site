<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4>What choices do Soceity/The individual have when it comes to Generative AI</h4>

<p class="main-text">
When it comes to Generative AI in education there are several choices that society, individuals and educational institutions can make to adapt to this this new technology 
<br><br>
 

One common choice a lot of education institutions are going with in response to this new technology is to outright ban its usage. Unfortunately, this response stops students from getting any of the benefits of AI in their learning however it ensures that students work is their own and not written by a model. One key problem with this choice is that itâ€™s hard to implement as detecting weather work is AI or not is incredibly difficult.

As a wider society we also have a lot of say on its usage weather we want to adapt it to become a part of all our lives or limit its usage to protect us from its ethical issues. These choices must come from governmental or global bodies to ensure coordination and ensure that ethical concerns are managed appropriately.
