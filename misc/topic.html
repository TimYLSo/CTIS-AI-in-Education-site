<p class="main-text">
	Over the past few years, a new technology has been developed and improved. This new technology known as Generative AI has made its way into many businesses and projects. One popular example, ChatGPT utilizes a massive neural network and has been trained on almost the entirety of the internet to answer any question. One key place that this technology has made its way into is the education sector. Almost every institution/school has put their own rules in place around its usage and many have outright banned it. This is because many students have found that it useful for writing their assignments and essays. Generative AI such as ChatGPT boast incredible performance, being able to write hundred-word essays in a matter of seconds. This is quite appealing to students as many despise massive writing assignments that are commonplace in high school/tertiary education. Some institutes have embraced its usage and allow students to use it as long as they don't plagiarize off it. However, it can be tempting to break this rule when assignments pile up and put a lot of pressure on students.  
	<br><br>

	Whether educators like it or not, students are discovering ways to incorporate AI into their school assignments. According to a study from the School of Psychology, Swansea University, United Kingdom out of a sample of 160 students' undergraduate students, almost 32% indicated that they would use generative AI tools in their work(Playfoot, David et al., 2024).  Similar surveys have produced similar results worldwide. a survey done by the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education reveals that 63.6% of survey participants from around the world are likely or very likely to employ the use of generative AI in the future(Yusuf abdullahi et l., 2024). From these findings it’s very clear that AI is no longer a niche tool. Most students are aware of it in at least some capacity, and many are actively using it in their assignments.

	The most common use, reported by 44.3% of students, is for information searching. For instance, they might use AI to quickly gather facts and data for research projects. Additionally, 39.4% of students use AI for paraphrasing text, which helps them rephrase content to avoid plagiarism in their assignments. 
	<br><br>
	AI is also a valuable tool for self-directed learning, with 28.5% of students using it to guide their independent studies. For example, they might use AI-driven tutoring systems to grasp difficult concepts outside of class. Moreover, 29.8% of students rely on AI to assist with assignments, such as using AI to organise their thoughts or generate ideas for essays.  
	<br><br>
	27.2% of students use AI to generate written content. This can include drafting essays, creating reports, or even developing creative writing pieces, so students don't have to write or plan their essays on their own anymore. 
	<br><br>
	It’s clear that this technology is going to have a massive impact on our futures and the future of Academia.
